# Constrained_GAN
A GAN model that is augmented with a number of constraints to control the properties of generated samples.

Generative Models,  and specially Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has shown significant perfor-mance in producing fake data with realistic properties.  However, existing models fail to fully characterize features of the generated data in terms of their feature values.  This is due to the randomness that is presentin current models.  In this paper, we propose a new frame-work forfake data generation with feature-valuecontrol.  In fact, our model provides full control over the features of the generated samples through a two-step process, which are, unconstrained training, and constrained optimization.  Since our focus is on generating constrained  time-series,  we  use  Recurrent-GAN  (RGANs)  in  the  first  step.   This RGAN is  trained  witha set of input time-series.  In the second step,  the trained RGAN is used in an optimization formulation to  generate  constrained  time-series.   In  fact,  the  second  step  can  captured  by  a  constrained  optimization problem, which a good solution of it is obtained through an iterative method.
